## Image Classifier using CNN on Cifar10 dataset

This is an open-source software that provides an image classification tool using a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the Cifar10 dataset. The software achieves an accuracy of 84% on test and train data.

## Getting Started
To use this software, you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer. You can download the software by cloning the repository or by downloading the SoftwareProfiling.ipynb notebook directly. You can then run the cells in the notebook to classify images into different categories.

Please note that this is a trained CNN, and a dedicated GPU is necessary for smooth training and desirable results.

## Dependencies
This software is built using TensorFlow and Keras libraries. Please make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

* Python 3
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* Jupyter Notebook

For the performance analysis of the software profiling tools are used. Please ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

* TensorBoard
* memory_profiler
* cProfile
* SnakeViz

Memory profiling tools as and when required have been installed in-line using the pip command.

## Installation
You can install the software using standard package managers or by downloading pre-built binaries. To build from source, you can use standard build tools.

## Usage
Once you have downloaded the notebook, open it in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells. The notebook contains a detailed explanation of how the model works and how to use it. You can also customize the model and train it on your own dataset.
